💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
<br><br>
📌 Introduction

Credit card fraud has become one of the fastest-growing cybercrimes, resulting in billions of dollars in losses every year. With the rise in online transactions, it’s critical to detect suspicious activities before they cause harm. This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze transaction patterns and identify fraudulent activity in credit card usage.

Fraudulent activity can include:

  1.Unauthorized use of a stolen card

  2.Leaked credit card details being exploited online

  3.Fake accounts created using stolen identities

By building and evaluating different models, this project aims to compare their effectiveness and determine which performs best for fraud detection.

🎯 Objectives

  1.Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time datasets.

  2.Compare multiple ML algorithms and analyze their accuracy.

  3.Provide visual insights into the dataset and prediction results.

  4.Build a scalable baseline model that can be extended for real-world deployment.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle:
👉 Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Key details:

1.Transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013 (2 days).

2.Total rows: 284,808

3.Features: 31

28 features transformed using PCA (for confidentiality)

Time: Seconds elapsed between transactions

Amount: Transaction amount

Class: Target variable (0 → Legitimate, 1 → Fraudulent)

⚙️ Methodology

The following machine learning models were implemented and compared:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Each model was trained, tested, and evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine suitability for fraud detection.

🔮 Future Scope

Experiment with ensemble methods like Random Forests, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

Apply deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks, LSTMs) for sequential transaction patterns.

Incorporate additional features such as location tracking and device fingerprints for stronger fraud detection.

Deploy as a real-time API service to integrate with banking systems.

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates that machine learning can be effectively applied to credit card fraud detection. Among the models tested, KNN and Decision Tree performed with the highest accuracy. While promising, further tuning and additional datasets are needed to ensure robustness in real-world environments.

Fraud detection not only improves customer trust and security, but also helps financial institutions reduce massive monetary losses.
