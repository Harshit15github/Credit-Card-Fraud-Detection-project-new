# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Introduction  
Credit card fraud is one of the fastest-growing cybercrimes, leading to billions of dollars in annual losses. With the rapid increase in digital transactions, detecting suspicious activities has become crucial.  

This project applies **machine learning algorithms** to identify fraudulent transactions by learning transaction patterns and distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent behavior.  

Fraudulent activities include:  
- Unauthorized use of stolen credit cards  
- Exploiting leaked card details for purchases  
- Fake accounts created using stolen identities  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions from real-world data.  
- Implement and compare multiple ML algorithms.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**.  
- Provide visual insights into fraud detection results.

## 📊 Dataset  
Dataset used: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  

**Dataset details:**  
- Transactions from European cardholders (2013, 2 days).  
- **Rows:** 284,808  
- **Features:** 31  
  - 28 features transformed using **PCA** for confidentiality.  
  - `Time` → Seconds elapsed since first transaction.  
  - `Amount` → Transaction amount.  
  - `Class` → Target (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent).

## ⚙️ Methodology  
The following machine learning models were applied and compared:  
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
2. **Logistic Regression**  
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
4. **Decision Tree**  

Models were evaluated using standard performance metrics and visualizations.

## 🔮 Future Scope  
- Use **ensemble models** like Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting.  
- Apply **deep learning architectures** (ANN, LSTM) for sequential data analysis.  
- Integrate contextual data (location, device ID, IP) for stronger fraud detection.  
- Deploy as a **real-time fraud detection API** for banking applications.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion  
The project successfully demonstrates the application of ML in fraud detection. Among tested models, **KNN and Decision Tree** delivered the best accuracy.  

However, real-world deployment requires:  
- More diverse datasets  
- Robust handling of class imbalance  
- Continuous retraining for evolving fraud patterns  

Fraud detection ensures **customer security**, reduces **financial losses**, and builds **trust in digital payments**.
